    "1. One-step learning method $\\rightarrow$ learn dynamics by computing derivatives from time-series data, then solve the optimization problem through machine learning methods. (No assumption of governing equations).\n",
    "$$ \\dot{x} = f(x, u) $$\n",
    "2. LmmNet $\\rightarrow$ learn dynamics by embedding a supervised learning problem inside a linear multistep method. This method assumes highly idealized setting where the data points are sampled at regular intervals. This issue can be overcome by using a 'data augmentation' strategy.\n",
