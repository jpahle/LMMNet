    "The species involved are:\n",
    "- Maturation-promoting factor (MPF): a.k.a. mitosis-promoting factor or m-phase promoting factor. This is the activated MPF with one phosphate group removed from cdk1 (relative to pre-MPF).\n",
    "- pre-MPF. Both activated MPF and pre-MPF consists of cdk-1 and cycB (cyclin).\n",
    "- cdk1: cyclin-dependent kinase, also called cdc2\n",
    "- cyclin: is alternately (cyclically) synthesized and degraded over time.\n",
    "- wee1: opposes MPF activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "G2 to M phase transition is driven by increase in MPF. One can regulate Cdk/MPF activity via either:\n",
    "1. synthesis/degradation of cyclin\n",
    "2. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of cdk\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activation of MPF** by removing an inhibitory phosphate from the cdk subunit. MPF regulation involves positive feedback:\n",
    "* One of the targets that cdk phosporylates is the protein cdc25, which is a phosphatase. Cdc25 becomes active when it gains a phosphate group.\n",
    "* One of the targets of Cdc25 is pre-MPF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence mutual activation: MPF activity increases cdc25 activity and vice versa, can lead to bistability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deactivation of MPF** by putting an inhibitory phosphate to the cdk subunit. This occurs through the protein wee1. But MPF inhibits wee1.\n",

    "[Boutros et al. (2007) Nat Rev Cancer 7, 495-507](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc2169). a | Cell division cycle 25 (CDC25) phosphatases dephosphorylate and activate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)–cyclin complexes, thus allowing catalysis and substrate phosphorylation. WEE1 and MYT1 kinases phosphorylate CDK on tyrosine 15 and threonine 14 of CDK1. Phosphorylation by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is required for further activation of CDK–cyclin complexes. For simplicity, an orange P represents T14 and Y15 phosphorylation by WEE1 and MYT1, a blue P represents T161 phosphorylation by CAK. b | Although initial studies suggested a specific role for each CDC25 phosphatase at defined stages of the cell cycle, the current model is that CDC25A, B and C are all involved in phosphorylating CDK–cyclin complexes, such as CDK2–cyclin E at the G1–S transition or CDK1–cyclin B at the entry into mitosis. c | CDC25A, B and C control entry and progression into mitosis. CDC25B is thought to be responsible for the initial activation of CDK1–cyclin B at the centrosome that contributes to microtubule network reorganization and mitotic spindle assembly. Nuclear translocation leads to an auto-amplification process (bold arrows) of CDC25s that then fire the bulk of CDK1–cyclin B complexes and trigger mitosis."
