    "- pre-MPF. Both activated MPF and pre-MPF consists of cdk-1 and cycB (cyclin).\n",

(2007) Nat Rev Cancer 7, 495-507](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc2169). a | Cell division cycle 25 (CDC25) phosphatases dephosphorylate and activate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)–cyclin complexes, thus allowing catalysis and substrate phosphorylation. WEE1 and MYT1 kinases phosphorylate CDK on tyrosine 15 and threonine 14 of CDK1. Phosphorylation by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is required for further activation of CDK–cyclin complexes. For simplicity, an orange P represents T14 and Y15 phosphorylation by WEE1 and MYT1, a blue P represents T161 phosphorylation by CAK. b | Although initial studies suggested a specific role for each CDC25 phosphatase at defined stages of the cell cycle, the current model is that CDC25A, B and C are all involved in phosphorylating CDK–cyclin complexes, such as CDK2–cyclin E at the G1–S transition or CDK1–cyclin B at the entry into mitosis. c | CDC25A, B and C control entry and progression into mitosis. CDC25B is thought to be responsible for the initial activation of CDK1–cyclin B at the centrosome that contributes to microtubule network reorganization and mitotic spindle assembly. Nuclear translocation leads to an auto-amplification process (bold arrows) of CDC25s that then fire the bulk of CDK1–cyclin B complexes and trigger mitosis."
