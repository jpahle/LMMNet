    "# Predicting Pathway Dynamics using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first half of the project, we use experimental data from proteomics and metabolomics to predict the metabolic pathway dynamics of either limonene or isopentenol produced by Escherichia Coli strains. In bioengineering, we often want to predict the cell behavior that results from the engineered changes in DNA. This is made possible thanks to the recent technological advances:\n",
    "1. new synthetic biology capabilities, such as the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9,\n",
    "2. Availability of proteomics and metabolomics data\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning these data into actionable insights is not trivial. While stoichiometric models ignore enzyme kinetics and cannot accurately capture the dynamics, kinetic models also have limitations:\n",
    "* the kinetic parameters are estimated from in-vitro measurements which may not be valid in in-vivo conditions/experiments\n",
    "* knowledge of the kinetic rate law for each specific reaction is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an ML approach could be automatically applied to any new pathway, improve in accuracy with more training data, and help in capturing complex dynamic relationships that are otherwise unknown. It also enables faster development of predictive pathway dynamics since all required knowledge is inferred from the experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](image/machine-learning.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to join the metabolites and protein tables, while creating the training data set consisting of:\n",
    "* smoothed features (using [Savitzky-Golay](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/SavitzkyGolay.html) low-pass filter)\n",
    "* targets obtained by taking the derivative of the interpolated (smoothed) measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use TPOT to automate the ML pipeline: https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot. Cross-validation with learning curve is used to compare pipelines. For an interpretation of the learning curve, see: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/learning_curve.html#learning-curve\n",
